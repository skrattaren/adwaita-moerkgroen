Adwaita Dark Green
==================

About
-----

Adwaita Dark Green is based on Adwaita but with a darker colour set (inspired by [Mediterranean Night Dark](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/MediterraneanNight+Series?content=156782)) and dark menu bars.

I find Adwaita too bright, and the Mediterranean series didn't keep up with GTK3's progress, so I made my own version. I used Adwaita as a base as it made integrating changes to GTK's internal changes easier.

The Theme
---------

Adwaita Dark Green includes GTK2, GTK3 (3.16, 3.18 and 3.20/3.22) and Metacity themes.
